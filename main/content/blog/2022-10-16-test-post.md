summary: "Just a sandbox post to play with Hugo"
---

This isn't going to be a very exciting blog. This is really just to try out
Hugo and play around with some things.

This will probably be the only post for a while, so let's play with some markup
with Hugo!

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Yay it's Go!")
}
```

This 'post' will grow with some more sandboxy playground things.
