    <h1>The Eversite</h1>
    <p>
      A site for personal stuff, built and deployed as a hobby project. Lots
      done from scratch for funsies, which mean there's plenty that's rough
      around the edges. Like the whole layout, which should really be one of the
      many Hugo templates available but that would be no fun.

      Check out the <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> I guess, but there's not a lot
      here yet. The footer will take you to the Github repo that controls all
      this, which is much more interesting than the site itself!
